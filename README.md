FULL DESCRIPTION
Amplitextria, or AXT, is a medium sized modpack that has elements of tech, magic, adventure and decor. Although AXT focuses mostly on tech mods like Create, Tinker's Construct, and ComputerCraft, this modpack includes large adventure focused mods like Twilight Forest, and Biomes O' Plenty. We also have mods that improve your base like Pam's Harvest Craft, Builder's crafts and Additions and various Macaw's Building related mods. Additions like Optifine, JEI, Dynamic Surroundings, and Xaero's Minimap make this modpack interesting, immersive, and easy to enjoy. This balance of tech, magic, adventure and decor make this mod perfect for players with multiple insterests and for mutiplayer servers where people play for different reasons. For example, you can go exploring or mining and come back with materials either to build a new component, expand your farm, or decorate your house. Come and enjoy your new adventure in Amplitextria.

Cool things I like about this modpack.
Some cool things about this modpack are the connectivity between the mods. Especially between Create, Industrial foregoing, Create Crafts & Additions, and Powah. I made a machine that automatically makes plastic(Industrial Foregoing) by getting all the liquid materials pumped with Pipes(Create) and supplied everthing that needed power using energy cables(Powah). I also have the option to convert this Forge Energy into Mechanical Energy and back again with Create Crafts & Additions. I also have a Mob Imprisonment Tool(Industrial Foregoing) if I ever need to put mobs into my smeltery(Tinker's Construct). The automation from ComputerCraft also is very helpful. Me and a friend made a automatic tree farm program to farm trees and as a byproduct it produces oak saplings which can be put into a Bioreactor(Industrial Foregoing) Also, Twilight Forest has support and features for Tinker's Construct.
